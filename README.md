## Learning Objective
The following points were the objective of the project . If you are looking for all the following points in this repo then i have not covered all in this repo. I'm working on blog about this mini project and I'll update the link of blog about all the points in details later . (The main intention was to create an end-to-end ML project.)

- Data gathering
- Descriptive Analysis
- Data Visualizations
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Modelling
- Model Evaluation
- Model Deployment
## Technical Aspect
- Using PowerBI dekstop create the report.
- Training a machine learning model using scikit-learn.
- Building and hosting a Flask web app on Render.
- A user has to put details like ram, battry power, Pixel resolution Height etc .
- Once it get all the fields information , the prediction is displayed on a new page .
## Usage/Examples

```javascript
app=Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def page():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__=='__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```


## Dataset
Now we can download the dataset on Kaggle and make analysis for it. Kaggle is the one of the largest website have to provide the datasets on verious domain.

```
    
## Lessons Learned

Now the bulding that project i can learn the concept of how to create the web in HTML and how to desing that page well attractive. Also i can get the knowlaged about the render to how exactly deploy the model on cloud.

In challanges my mesure challange is that how to select the best feature they are highly affected my responce.
and selection of the best model to improve the accuracy.
